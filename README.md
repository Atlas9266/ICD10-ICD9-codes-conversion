# ICD10-ICD9-codes-conversion

We created a database for conversion of the ICD10 to ICD9 codes, since most PheWAS algorithms uses the ICD9 codes. We downloaded the ICD9 and ICD10 codes from https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2018-ICD-10-CM-and-GEMs.html. We develped a python script to directly convert the ICD10 codes to ICD 9. Also we are working to develop a python script to convert the ICD9 codes to ICD10.
